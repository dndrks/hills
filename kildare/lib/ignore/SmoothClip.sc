// Dynamic waveshaping with line and sine fragment:

// As math is easier for the case lo == -1, hi == +1,
// we regard this case first and do linear mapping / remapping for other bounds:
// Take tangent through zero for abs(x) < given tangent point x0
// and sine fragment values above x0 and below 1, clip for abs values above 1.
// The transfer function is antisymmetrical, its slope tends to 0 for x -> +-1.
// Source and target range can be shifted with fromLo, fromHi, toLo, toHi.

// The sine fragment with minimum at x = 1 and f(1) = 1 has the form
// f(x) = p sin(pi/2 x) - p + 1
// f'(x) = p pi/2 cos(pi/2 x)

// Thus the tangent through x0 has the form
// p pi/2 cos(pi/2 x0) x = p sin(pi/2 x0) - p + 1

// So for a given tangent point 0 <= x0 < 1 we can calculate p as below.

// 'amount' indicates the amount of smoothing:
// amount == 0: in signal isn't altered
// amount == 1: in signal is shaped by full sine fragment
// amount expected to be >= 0 and <= 1
